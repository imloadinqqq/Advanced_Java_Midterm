3. Chat Room (100 points)
Name: Q3_ChatRoomServer.java and Q3_ChatRoomClient.java
Create a GUI chat room program using JavaFX. Specifically, create a multithreaded server
capable of handling multiple clients connecting to a single chat room. Allow the user to choose a
screen name in the client. When a user sends a message, the message is to be displayed on all
the other clients, prefixed with the screen name of the user who sent that message. The client is
to have a text area for displaying the conversation, a text field or text area for the user to enter
their message, and a button for the user to send their message. An additional text field and
button may be needed to allow the user to enter their screen name.
4. Mulario (50 points)
Name: Q4_Mulario.java
Write a GUI program using JavaFX. The idea of the program is to allow the user to control a
circle on the screen. When the user presses an arrow key, the circle is to move in that direction.
The program is to have small circles at random locations and of random colors on the screen.
As the user moves their circle over a smaller circle, the smaller circle is absorbed into the user's
circle, increasing the size of the user's circle. The program is to have text fields for the user to
set the color of their circle by specifying red, green, and blue values, each in the range of 0 -
255. Also have a check box for whether to display text on the circle indicating the size of the
circle.
